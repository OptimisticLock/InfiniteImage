Infinite Image
----------------

This is a collaborative SVG image editor. Think a classroom full of kids,
or a distributed group of people creating art together. Created for Meteor Hackathon
10/11/2015 together with a developer I met at the hackathon. 

As its name suggests, the editor is intended to be on an infininite canvass and highly
zoomable (like Google Maps), but that's on the roadmap. Drawing tools other than
pencils of various widths are work in progress and for that reason disabled.
